    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush an 8-inch square baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter.</li>

      <li>Pour milk into flour-butter mixture and stir with a rubber spatula until a soft dough forms.</li>
      <li>Turn dough out onto a well-floured work surface and roll dough into a 10- x 10-inch square. Brush surface of dough with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter.</li>
      <li>To make the filling: Whisk ¼ cup white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon cinnamon-sugar mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle remaining cinnamon sugar over butter-brushed dough.</li>
      <li>Roll dough around filling to form a log; cut log into 9 rolls about 1-inch wide; place rolls, cut-side up, in the prepared baking dish.</li>
